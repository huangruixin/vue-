To conclude the requirement of this project is showing information efficiently and use the advanced framework VUE. This system can be considered as a web App because it can be accessed by using both PC and mobile device. This system will be applied in the department of product research development and innovation center to illustrate the products information in Neusoft. RD management system will be used only by the employees of Neusoft and it will show limited information based on the different level of users, for example the heading manager can access most products’ details but normal developers will not be able to see some highly secret files. 

RD management system has a clear construction which includes six modules, for example, product information and product manager management. Each module has many children branches to show detailed reference and also provides functions, such as create, edit, delete and search, for users to operate with information. The author is responsible for communicating with back-end developers about how database well fits the front work. Accessing information from the database might need to operate many tables' data, where has a huge cascade connection. 

In terms of its UI, RD management system used white, blue and gray as the main color to bring a sense of efficiency to users. VUE also brings an advantages of responsive mode which means user can drag the browser’s window and the content of web page will fit well.
